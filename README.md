# Challenge 12, Plotly Belly Button Biodiversity

## Project Overview
We’ll use Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web

The goals of this challenge are to:

1. Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. 
2. Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
3. Complete the demographic information panel.


## Resources
- Software: VS Code (writing JavaScript)

# Summary
In this challenge, we created a panel for demographic information and visualized the bacterial data for each volunteer. Using the provided data in the json file, we identified the top 10 bacterial species in volunteers' belly buttons. The volunteers' demographic info, and also the identified bacterial species info were plotted.
